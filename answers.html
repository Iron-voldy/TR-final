                    The Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) is a systematic process used to design, develop, and maintain software applications efficiently. This structured approach ensures quality, reduces costs, and manages project timelines effectively.<br><br>
                    
                    <span class="keyword">Initially</span>, the process begins with Requirements Gathering, where stakeholders define functional and non-functional specifications. During this phase, project managers conduct meetings with clients to understand their needs and document detailed requirements.<br><br>
                    
                    <span class="keyword">Subsequently</span>, the System Design phase commences, where architects create technical specifications, database designs, and system architecture.

                    The table illustrates global smartphone sales by operating system from 2020 to 2024, showing market share percentages for Android, iOS, and other platforms over a five-year period.<br><br>
                    
                    <span class="keyword">Android demonstrates a declining trend</span>, decreasing from 71% in 2020 to 64% in 2024, representing a 7 percentage point drop. This downward trajectory shows consistent year-on-year decreases of approximately 1-2 percentage points.<br><br>
                    
                    <span class="keyword">Conversely, iOS exhibits steady growth</span>, rising from 27% in 2020 to 34% in 2024. This represents a 7 percentage point increase, with the most significant gains occurring in 2023-2024, where iOS captured 2 percentage points annually.<br><br>
                    
                    <span class="keyword">Other operating systems remained relatively stable</span>, fluctuating between 2-3% throughout the period, with minimal impact on the overall market dynamics.<br><br>
                    
                    <span class="keyword">The data reveals a clear market shift</span> where iOS is gaining ground at Android's expense. While Android maintains its dominant position with nearly two-thirds market share, the gap is narrowing considerably. This trend suggests increasing consumer preference for iOS devices, possibly due to factors such as brand loyalty, ecosystem integration, or premium device appeal. The consistent nature of these changes indicates a sustained market transition rather than temporary fluctuations.

                    <strong>Subject:</strong> URGENT: Critical LMS System Failures Affecting Online Lectures - Immediate Action Required<br><br>
                    
                    Dear Mr. [IT Director's Name],<br><br>
                    
                    I am writing to report critical system failures with our Learning Management System (LMS) that are significantly impacting academic operations and require immediate escalation.<br><br>
                    
                    <strong>Problem Description:</strong><br>
                    The LMS platform has been experiencing frequent crashes during peak usage hours, particularly during scheduled online lectures. These failures occur approximately every 15-20 minutes during active sessions, causing complete system disconnection for all users. Error logs indicate memory overflow issues and database connection timeouts during high concurrent user loads.<br><br>
                    
                    <strong>Impact Assessment:</strong><br>
                    This critical issue is severely affecting academic delivery with the following consequences:<br>
                    â€¢ 150+ students per lecture session are being disconnected repeatedly<br>
                    â€¢ Faculty members cannot complete scheduled teaching sessions<br>
                    â€¢ Assessment submissions are being lost during system crashes<br>
                    â€¢ Student learning experience and satisfaction are significantly compromised<br><br>
                    
                    <strong>Immediate Actions Recommended:</strong><br>
                    1. Deploy emergency load balancing to distribute user traffic<br>
                    2. Increase server memory allocation and database connection pools<br>
                    3. Implement session backup mechanisms to prevent data loss<br>
                    4. Schedule maintenance window for comprehensive system optimization<br><br>
                    
                    <strong>Resource Requirements:</strong><br>
                    I request authorization to engage our external LMS vendor for emergency technical support and approval for temporary server capacity upgrades to handle current user demand.<br><br>
                    
                    Given the critical nature of this issue affecting daily academic operations, I recommend treating this as a Priority 1 incident requiring immediate resolution within 24 hours.<br><br>
